Each version of The Very Big Cave Adventure has some differences.  Some are technical (e.g. more advanced audio and graphics in the C64 version), some are gameplay-related (e.g. clearing up the art gallery text after the initial release).

If you want to see differences between platforms in the original game, examine the decompiled sources.

If you want to see the platform-specific changes in the web-based version, read through the list of commits.  Changes that were made specifically to match other versions should be fairly well labeled, although changes *inspired* by different versions are harder to identify.

Here are some specific changes I looked at while writing the game:

* CPC
  * "draw" and "move" are synonyms for "unlock"
  * "taste" is a synonym for "lick"
  * "exit" is a synonym for "out"
  * "FART _" does something
  * "IGNO _" does something
  * "wand" is a synonym for "rod"
  * some different system messages
  * desks are not described as empty (because they're not)
  * "string" becomes "stream" of polysyllables
  * wellie-house text is different
  * "window over pit" description becomes a "deep pit"
  * "vast" removed from bat cave description
  * text slightly improved for:
    * west end of passage
    * east end of hall
    * heart of gotham
    * exam bubb
    * wate pell
    * falling in a sploosh hole
  * up from batmobile goes to small_low_cavern
  * commodore -> sugar
  * Fence has message when you GET his stuff
* C64
  * "commodore" -> "spectrum"
  * "move" is a synonym for "draw"
  * "extinguish" and "turn" are synonyms for "switch" (off)
  * "searchlight" is a synonym for "switch"
  * "FART _" does something (sound effect and CPC text)
  * "mirror" is a synonym for "look" (actually just reuses the ID - "look" is a verb, "mirror" is a noun)
  * new word: "sideboard"
  * "WAVE _" at window_over_pit does something
  * "PLUG _" writes different text
  * added room 18 (Avante Garde room)
    * plus exits from nearby rooms
    * "EXAM SIDE" (...board) does something
    * "EXAM L" (i.e. examine mirror) does something
  * even better text for window_over_pit
  * "EXAM CAR" does something
  * "HIT _" does something in the art gallery
  * "HIT L" (break mirror?) in the Avante Garde Room does something
  * better sound effects throughout
    * uses the C64's SID chip, which is hard to emulate
* STDCAV
  * initial description
  * Message 38: The inevitable happens and you fall in a pit. (if you water the pellet in the wrong place)
  * newspaper near news boy
  * "There is a weird sensation, then suddenly..." (pause) "... nothing happens"
  * description for moon-crystal, cupboard, utility belt
  * can drink the water
  * some text for the parser curtains
  * "commodore" -> "clones"
  * Fixes space invaders text
* Multiple versions
  * north from east_end_of_hall goes to hall_of_mists_west_end
  * Jester text cleaned up
    * all other versions (even spec+3) remove the broken Spectrum text
  * different "get bird" responses
    * CPC makes even less sense to me, C64 response suggests maybe the sound effect is supposed to be raspberries?
    * the Spectrum sound effect for "get bird" resembles the C64 sound effect for "fart", which again suggests raspberries
    * STDCAV response resembles the CPC response
    * how do you blow a raspberry if you have a beak?
    * consider using the exact same effect in both places, to indicate the same
  * many extra room messages are merged with the main room description
    * C64, CPC, STDCAV
