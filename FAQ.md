# Very Big Cave Adventure: Very Small FAQ

## How close is it to the original?

* The gameplay has been modified to make it enjoyable in a modern environment
* The graphics are upscaled versions of the Spectrum graphics

This game most closely resembles the final Spectrum release of The Very Big Cave Adventure, although it borrows liberally from every version (and even from The Spelunker's Tremendous Cave, another fan remake).

This game is a modern adaptation of a classic game.  Although it stays fairly close to the source material, players wanting precise emulation should go to [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/zx_Very_Big_Cave_Adventure_The_1986_CRL_Group_Part_1_of_2).
